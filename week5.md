**In-Class Exercise:** Today's activity is an ***ideathon***.

A ***hackathon*** is an intense 1 or 2 day event in which those working in tech (e.g. programmer, graphic designers, data scientists) work with domain experts to collaborate on software projects.

The goal of a hackathon is to create usable software or hardware with the goal of producing a functioning product by the end of the event. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, for example, on solving a single real-life problem.

An ***ideathon*** is like a hackathon wherein the participants focus on outlining solutions to real-life problems without implementing the solutions. The goal of an ideathon is to produce a concrete plan of action for solving a real-life problem at the end of the event.
Read the following document to prepare for the ideathon:
